Notes
-----

- need not be an entire course
- work with students in Computing 1
  - paid to work with me on the side
  - mini-class
- Computing 1 labs
  - 8-9 sections
  - assessments
  - everyone in course instroduced to LearnCS! at the beginning
  - surveys with students
    - did it help them think about the material?
  - flag in code to collect or not collect data
  - is there any correlation between use of LearnCS! and their performance
  - integrate with CS authentication system
  - track
    - do they use the notional machine depiction (default to not displayed)
    - breakpoint usage, as indication of looking at memory
    - correlate usage of LearnCS! with submissions to auto-grader
      - need to use known authentication to match
    - hyphothesis?
    - assessment
      - work with LearnCS! correlated to submission time
      - students who use tool do better on tests
      - take less time on assignments
      - assignment scores are higher
      - number of submissions?

- develop labs that can be used with or without LearnCS! except for first few
  labs which will all use LearnCS!
